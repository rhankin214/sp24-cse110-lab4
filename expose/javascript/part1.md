1. 'values added: ' + (num1 + num2), in this case 'values added: 20'
2. 'final result: 20'

3. like before, 'values added: 20'
4. Error. 'result' doesn't exist outside the if block. 

5. Error. We attempted to reassign a const variable so the code's not gonna get to line 9
6. Same answer as the last. We're never gonna run line 13 either.
